step 1: jump into the directory whose code you want to push 
step 2: initialise github using ("git init)
step 3: add all the files of the directory using ("git add .")
step 4: to push need to add some comment  ("git commit -m "message")
step 5: now declare the branch ("git branch -M main")
step 6: give the repo link ("git remote add origin https://github.com/Officialvirus/Qspider.git")
step 7: now push the files("git push -u origin main)
